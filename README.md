# Kurdish Calendar Privacy Policy
Kurdish Calendar is developed and maintained by individual volunteers and not represented by any legal entity. The community doesn't need your data, so the app are designed to be fully GDPR compliant. Read on to learn more.

# What data the Kurdish Calendar app might collect, store and process

The app only records data strictly necessary for its function, which is the app settings, last shown tab, last installed version, and very minor things like that. The app does not include any advertisement libraries or any 3rd party tracking (analytics) code, such as Google Analytics.

All data provided and created when using the app is stored locally on your device. The app does not send or upload your data as it doesn't get Internet access from the system.

# App permissions

The app requests the following privacy-relevant Android permissions:

Access location only in the foreground: User requested opt-in to set location locally on the app, which further improves calendar-related algorithms and functions (owghat times, season pictures, etc.).
Read calendar events and details: User requested opt-in to show calendar events in the calendar. 

# What app data other parties might collect, store and process

Google: If you have activated backup & reset in your phone settings (Settings → Backup & Reset → Back up my data), you should be aware that Android itself will periodically save a copy of your phone’s data on Google’s servers. It may also include data from Kurdish Calendar and from other apps you use. The developers of the Kurdish Calendar do not have access to this data.
Device provided geocoder service: When location is set on the app by GPS or manually by coordination or clicking on the map, the app asks from device provided geocoder service about your location name so it can show it to yourself in the app. It is optional and you can either choose from available list of cities on the app or disconnect from Internet so coordination can be set on the app without geocoder service query or you can just don't set location which isn't needed for functioning of the app.
What data the Kurdish Calendar core team may have access to

The developers of Kurdish Calendar do not have access to any of your information, except when you

Actively share debugging information (either via email using the personal email function or via the Android crash reporting functionality of Google):
your publicly available name and email address

Applicability of The Privacy Policy
This privacy policy applies to all information we collect through our web and mobile applications from Calendar users, including you.

Throughout this policy, we use the term “personal information” to describe information that can be associated with a specific person and can be used to identify that person. We do not consider personal information to include information that has been anonymized so that it does not identify a specific user.

# The Information We Collect
When you visit the website or use one of our mobile applications, we collect your IP address, and standard web log information, such as your browser type and the pages you accessed on our website. We also may collect certain geo-location information. We may combine information automatically collected with other information that we have collected about you including from publicly available sources. If you do not agree to our collection of this information, you may not be able to use our Service.

In order to help you protect yourself and your information, we encourage you to provide only that information that is necessary for using our Platform. For example, to schedule a meeting you may only need to provide us with a name, email address, date and time.

If you open an account, we collect the following information from you. You provide this information voluntarily by using our product:

# Identification Information
Your name, street address, email address, date of birth, and SSN (or other governmental issued verification numbers).

# Device Information
We also may obtain information about you: (a) from your mobile device such as your device type, machine or mobile device identification number, geo-location, time zone, language setting, browser type, and IP address, and (b) from third parties for purposes of transaction processing, identity verification, fraud detection or prevention and other similar purposes. For fraud prevention purposes, we also may link your machine ID with the machines of others who use your same payment cards.

# Appointment Information
When a Calendar User comes to Calendar to schedule an event with a Calendar Member, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, email address and phone number; email addresses of other people; subject of the meeting; and any other information you provide us or as required by the Calendar Member you are scheduling with. If you receive an invitation from a Calendar Member but do not wish to become a Calendar User, please contact the Calendar Member who sent the invitation through other means to set up your meeting. 

# Connecting a Calendar
A Calendar Member may also connect their calendar with Calendar. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when you’re busy. We never know who you’re meeting with, their email, the meeting title or any other details about the appointments in your calendar.

# Social Web Information
Including but not limited to your Google connect credentials (and information that you authorize Google share with us though permissions) and email account information. If you authorize Google Connect, the plug in allows us access to your friends’ contact information. We also allow you to import data from other social web services, including but not limited to Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, Google+, Linkedin, email lists and email service providers.

Social and e-mail contact information helps you connect to friends and contacts for invitation and payment transmission purposes (as well as helping us improve our services and fight fraud). Additionally, another Calendar user may mention you in a transaction in which you are not a party to by “tagging” your username in a transaction note. When you are mentioned in a transaction, a link to your Calendar profile will appear in the transaction note and you will receive a notification about the mentions. You may manage certain contact preferences and notifications in your account settings.

# Financial Information
Bank account and routing numbers and credit cards linked to your Calendar account. If you purchase any premium or enterprise version of Calendar, our third-party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, card type and the expiration date.

We are committed to providing a safe, secure and all around great service. Therefore, before permitting you to use our Service, we may require additional information from you we can use to verify your identity, address or other information or to manage risk and compliance throughout our relationship. We may also obtain information about you from third parties such as identity verification, fraud prevention and similar services.

When you are using the Calendar Service, we collect information about your account transactions and trust relationships and we may collect information about your computer or other access device for fraud prevention and other similar purposes.

Finally, we may collect additional information from or about you in other ways not specifically described here. For example, we may collect information related to your contact with our customer support team or store results when you respond to a survey.

# Information Collected Automatically
Like many websites, we and our service providers use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device subject to your opt-out preferences (see Your Rights and Choices section below). Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Services, improve your experience, and tailor marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:

Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings.
